The action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. Where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and Neo\\'s life in the Matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?). That being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the Matrix plays with your mind. I honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. From the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. However, once the climactic moments hit, I was enthralled. The helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard. I\\'m curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start.
