    "# ReasoningAgent - Advanced LLM Reasoning with Multiple Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems even when using smaller models like `gpt-4o-mini`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Beam Search (Default)\n",
    "- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step\n",
    "- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria\n",
    "- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation\n",
    "- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\n",
    "- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula\n",
    "- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards\n",
    "- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima\n",
    "- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)\n",
    "- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation\n",
    "- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement\n",
    "- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process\n",
    "2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step\n",
    "3. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration\n",
    "4. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths\n",
    "5. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration Options\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary:"

      "1. **Clear Structure**: The response is well-organized into distinct steps, making it easier for the reader to follow the logical flow of the argument.\n",

      "1. **Lack of Detailed Calculation**: While it outlines the formula for calculating expected maximums, it does not execute the calculations that would explicitly show how the approximate value of **4.96** is reached. Adding detailed calculations would significantly enhance the completeness and educational value.\n",
